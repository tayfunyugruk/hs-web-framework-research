It also helps the body form hemoglobin, the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body. Not getting enough vitamin B6 has been linked to negative impacts on brain health that may result in confusion, in addition it can also cause forms of anemia due to not being able to form enough hemoglobin, which in turn may cause feelings of fatigue, weakness or tiredness (commonly referred to as “brain fog”). Phenology's Daily Duet gummies contain 100% of the Daily Value of vitamin B6 for women in the menopausal age range.<\/p>",
